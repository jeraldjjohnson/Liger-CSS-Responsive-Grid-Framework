# Liger CSS Responsive Grid Framework
Beta version. 

No two design environments are the same. Designing in a startup company is drastically different from a large company. Liger is born from years of me working as a web designer in a Fortune 500 company.

Although anybody is free to use this, Liger is css grid with web designers & developers working in a huge corporate environment in mind.

With Liger you can customize your css to use only the css you want, develop responsive websites in a more natural way with a desktop first approach, and much more! 

index.html is a sample file that shows how the grid works as well as the various components. It's meant to be a reference if you need. View the rendered index page at http://jeraldjjohnson.github.io/Liger-CSS-Responsive-Grid-Framework/
